# Data-Science-Portfolio
A group of my data science projects to demonstrate my skills, knowledge and interests.

## [Project 1: MMA Fighters Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/MMA-Fighters-Dataset-Analysis)

In this project I have a lot of interest for watching mma fights and was curious to see if there was any common strategies, fighting styles, or trends that resulted in fighters getting more victories or better performances in their fights. I found out that fighters who have a speciality in performing takedowns and grappling, consistently have more victories, are able to have higher striking accuracy and absorb less significant strikes over the course of their career. Grapplers are able to more consistently gain a dominanat position on the ground and control the fight from there. 

The data I went to the list of fighters to get the URL's to their fighter profiles, and from there visted each url to extract 23 features that would make the raw dataset The framework used to scrape/collect the data was python scrapy. Feature Engineering and Data cleaning was done with with Pandas Numpy.The Explaratory Data Anaylysis and Visualisation was performed with Seaborn and Matplotlib. The deployment was done with Streamlit.
