# Data-Science-Portfolio
A group of my data science projects to demonstrate my skills, knowledge and interests.

## [Project 1: MMA Fighters Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/MMA-Fighters-Dataset-Analysis)

In this project I have a lot of interest for watching mma fights and was curious to see if there was any common strategies, fighting styles, or trends that resulted in fighters getting more victories or better performances in their fights. I found out that fighters who have a speciality in performing takedowns and grappling, consistently have more victories, are able to have higher striking accuracy and absorb less significant strikes over the course of their career. Grapplers are able to more consistently gain a dominanat position on the ground and control the fight from there. 

The data I went to the list of fighters to get the URL's to their fighter profiles, and from there visted each url to extract 23 features that would make the raw dataset The framework used to scrape/collect the data was python scrapy. Feature Engineering and Data cleaning was done with with Pandas Numpy.The Explaratory Data Anaylysis and Visualisation was performed with Seaborn and Matplotlib. The deployment was done with Streamlit.


## [Project 2: Maven-Fuzzy-Factory-Ecommerce-Store-Analysis](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/Maven-Fuzzy-Factory-Ecommerce-Store-Analysis)
In this project I have assumed the role of a data analyst for the Maven Fuzzy Factory Ecommerce start-up where I work with the CEO, Marketing Director and Website Manager to analyze the performance of the website and help grow the business by guiding its actions. I use advanced SQL queries to perform the tasks that a business intelligence professional or data analyst would encounter in real life.
SQL skills demonstrated: use of TEMPORARY TABLES, Pivoting Data in SQL, use of SUBQUERIES, writing DATA programs, use of aggregate functions, use of DATE functions

Analytical Skills Demonstrated: Website Traffic Analysis and Optimization, Website Measurement and Testing, Channel Portfolio Management, Business Patterns and Seasonality, Product Analysis, User Analysis

## [Project 3: Covid-19 Dataset Analysis and Tableau Dashboard Visualization](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/COVID-Dataset-Analysis-and-Exploration)
In this project I analyze a covid 19 dataset that includes the new cases, vaccinations, deaths, infections, etc. I use SQL to find different trends in the data such as percent of the population that are vaccinated, finding contintents with the highest death count per population, countries with the highest infection rate, etc. The SQL skills demonstrated include joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

Then I created a dashboard with tableau to share some these insights that I found when I analyzed the data with SQL.

## [Project 4: Bangalore Restaurant Ratings Predictor](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/Restaurant-Rating-Predictor)
In this project I explored the different features of the dataset in order to determine the different trends and explore the characteristics of Bangalores highest rated restaurants. This information would then be used to produce a machine learning model that can predict the rating a restaurant would have if they enter information about their restaurant such as the price of a meal, restaurant type, location, and the menu items available.

The skills demonstrated in this project are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pyplot, Seaborn, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Extra-Trees Regression, Random Forest Regression

## [Project 5: USA Unemployment Rate Exploratory Data Analysis with FRED API](https://github.com/himnishchopra1/EDA-on-Unemployment-Rate)
In this project I aimed to explore and use the FRED API which is provided by https://fred.stlouisfed.org/. It allows me to retrieve economic data from the FRED websites hosted by the Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St louis.  In this analysis was done to investigate the relationship between the unemployment rate, and the participation rate of the population of different states in the USA. It was determined that when unemployment rate went up the participation sharply decreased for most states. 

The skills demonstrated in this project are Pandas, matplotlib, plotly, Numpy
